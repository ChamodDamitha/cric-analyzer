19.4  kohli throws his wicket away with a loose drive to extra cover fielder. full in length and the urge to drive on the up swallows him. he started off in an slightly  iffy manner against the new ball but settled down to play well but he is gone now. he had driven loosely in the second ball of this over but it had not gone in the air but this time a similar ball has fetched his wicket  75/4
17.3  but he is gone now! inside edge and on to the stumps kohli is very disappointed. it bounced from short of length more pace than the other two bowlers so far and kohli tried to push it to cover point with an angled bat well away from the body but the ball collided with the inside edge and crashed on to the off stump. enter dhoni.  81/3
10.3  he's finally got the lbw! kulasekara has repeatedly hit kohli on the pad as he moves across his stumps to the ball that cuts into the right-hander the impact has been high on previous occasions but this time the ball hits him on the knee roll and the umpire raises the finger  45/2
21.3  kohli rushes down the track and lofts it high towards long-off where gul is stationed. gul back-pedals to catch it but it bounds off his palms .. gul swoops down to catch it but it again bounces off his palms but he nails it the third time!  126/3
20.4  virat is once again caught at long-off. we have seen that quite often in the ipl and champions league games as well. he charged down the track but was beaten in flight tried to go though with the shot and skied it up. watson ran in from long-off to take a good catch  103/3
14.3  poor shot bollinger angles it outside off and cramps kohli for a bit if room as he shapes to cut it square on the off side he ends up getting a tame edge to the keeper  78/2
47.2  bowled him a touch slower 127ks he is looking to hit this length delivery across the line and over midwicket misses and is gone  386/7
39.2  skips out and looks to dump this over long-on but ends up miscuing it its up there for a while and the sub pushpakumara settles under it and cups it just in front of the boundary ending a very pleasing century from kohli  247/3
6.5  great reflexes by sangakkara! comes round the wicket kohli tries to cheekily nudge it down to third man but gets a thick edge sanga falls to his right and catches it  62/2
34.6  shakib holds on to one this time this one is flighted generously kohli - cramping - has to reach out for the drive is not to the pitch of the ball and ends up hitting it low and back to shakib. well played kohli bangladesh have look-in again just when it started to look like a cruise  203/4
36.2  fantastic catch from gibbs to break the partnership it was a fuller delivery than the previous one kohli chipped it to the on-side gibbs leaps to his left from short midwicket and plucks a low catch  204/5
27.6  edged and taken! steyn gets another! kohli looks to steer this one down to third man the bowl holds its line a touch and gets a regulation edge for a regulation catch for boucher  157/5
34.2  finally the frustration of finding the fielders again and again has got to kohli. looks to clear long-off this time but doesn't get any power in this shot and holes out jeewan mendis taking a nice safe catch  171/4
14.4  lovely bit of bowling from shakib! flight outside off and turn luring kohli forward and breaking past his off stump. his back foot strayed out of the crease and he could not get back entirely in time. toes on the line bails in the air. third umpire takes  a few close looks at it and says kohli is out.  80/2
17.4  played on! kohli looks to cut but it is too full and he duly gets a bottom edge. looks at the pitch  suggesting perhaps that it stayed low but it wasn't the correct shot. he misread the length and paid the price  82/2
14.3  he's a goner this time! maharoof keeps it outside off moved away ever so slightly from off stump and it was enough to fox kohli and get the edge as he prodded unconvincingly off the back foot. sangakkara leaps in joy after pouching it and that's another failure for kohli in the asia cup.  75/2
18.2  malinga takes out virat. it kicked up outside off from short of length and virat stabbed at it bat away from the body. edge and gone!  100/2
9.6  what a lovely catch from sanga! fernando teased kohli with a fuller delivery outside off stump and he fell for the bait. he edged the intended off drive and sanga flew full stretch with an outstretched right hand to pouch that. what a stunner!  31/2
5.4  virat is stunned. he doesn't move. he stares at the umpire ashoka. he looks at his partner. now he stirs into action and walks away slowly. very slowly. this is what happened: it was a length delivery just outside off stump and virat pushed out at it bat away from the body. the keeper went up straight away. the fatal finger went up. got to see the replays to confirm the edge. replays in: there was some noise plus the snickometer shows there was a nick!  27/2
21.1  perera the indian specialist strikes. it was the short-of-length delivery cutting away like a leg cutter and virat went for the pull. too late. the ball flew of the edge to third man. gone! vital vital moment this  109/4
43.2  kohli has holed out with the task unaccomplished but he has certainly set the game up for india full on middle and he smacks it cleanly but straight into the hands of hopes at long-on  256/4
43.6  virat falls after another big innings. short and wide; the slower bouncer he reached out to tamely tap it to cover! a highest of 37 in seven games but he has changed things around now with two consecutive hundreds.  250/5
36.5  smart work by taylor at midwicket short and it seemed it was on its way for the fourth boundary of the over pulled hard but taylor leapt palmed it with one hand and clasped it with both on its way down to complete a neat catch no third straight ton for kohli though he looked good to get it  203/2
9.6  mckay has two! kohli is gone for a duck after having scored 50 or more in his four previous innings. mckay's energy shows as he bowls another bouncer angled across kohli who goes for the hook gets a chunky top edge to mills at long leg. new zealand are right back  68/2
3.2  dan gets his man now it was fired in on the stumps virat chose to stay on the back foot the ball went off the push to taylor at slip who held on to the sharp take game on here bring it on!  10/2
29.3  kohli perishes. almost compelled to make the powerplay count. barring a miracle and a dream this should be the end of india's challenge. back of a length from steyn not there for the whip over the infield. kholi goes for the shot but can't time it well enough to clear smith at midwicket in the circle who hauls it in. end of a promising innings. promised a bit today. promised a lot for the future.  128/6
14.6  morkel's persistence pays off short of a good length but much closer to off stump this time with the right amount of nip kohli plays at that one and feathers it to the keeper good consistent line from morkel has reaped its reward  56/2
6.1  a rare failure for virat kohli. morne does him with sheer pace. back of a length and extra bounce from outside off kohli committed to the check-drive into the covers early. on second thoughts he may have wanted to leave it. it is through him in a jiffy taking the outside edge through to the keeper  31/2
14.3  clatter! it landed full on a length around off stump line  and moved in a touch. virat went for the off drive but drove outside the line and the ball went through the big gap to peg back the off stump  99/4
43.6  bizarre batting virat pushes the ball gently back to peterson a easy caught and bowled. south africa are right back in this. peterson flings the ball in celebration and they are pumped.  286/6
32.2  rampaul does it again. will this 'reverse' the momentum? top bowling from rampaul gets it to nip in sharply from a length outside off. kohli plonks the front foot across plays a swat-swipe across the line rivalled in ugliness only by the shot michael clarke played yesterday. the ball sneaks past and upsets the furniture. it is one of kohli's main scoring shots but at times he doesn't pull it off that well.  173/3
28.3  kohli has thrown it away totally against the run of play full toss on the stumps he threw his bat wildly at it but only found the man at midwicket david cannot believe it he is smiling wildly virat is disappointed but he has to go  143/3
25.2  pakistan have taken a catch! wahab strikes again! caught at backward point. it landed on a length around off and angled away virat played a strange shot as if he was surprised by how it seamed away - wahab hardly gets the ball to bend in - and had a weak waft at it. he just stabbed at it. edge and pouched!  141/3
21.4  dilshan! he's taken a blinder off his own bowling! kohli drives and tries to get it back past the bowler towards long-on but dilshan just sticks his right hand up in the air almost in front of the non-striker's face and plucks a magnificent catch! could that be a decisive moment? it could very well be!  114/3
6.5  chasing a wide one and kohli will be livid with that short and he went for the cut got a thin edge and baugh made no mistake a loose shot and he's paid the price  34/2
7.4  well well darren sammy has brought the sparse crowd to life he has snared virat first ball that harmless looking length ball that suddenly decides to nip back in sharply virat is caught on the crease and takes it on the pads that looked to be going down leg the umpire did not think so in fact it would have bounced over as well as replays show shocker that one but virat is gone what was that about the drs again?  26/2
20.6  stumped was bowled flat and a little wider kohli made room to drive it through the off side it turns away and misses the bat baugh collects well and takes off the bails in no time good work with the gloves kohli has to go his foot was in the air big wicket  82/4
39.3  the perfect comeback! samit pushes his next ball through a touch quicker kohli leans back for the cut but under-edges onto his stumps!  206/4
16.6  this is half mis-hit half hung in the wind. charges at swann and hits this into the wind towards long-on and finds bell to perfection  125/3
10.2  kohli's struggle has ended and this is now too easy for anderson. he pitches just short of a length outside off and seams the ball away kohli stays in his crease and hangs his bat out getting an edge to the wicketkeeper. soft soft dismissal. anderson is having a terrific game three wickets and a direct hit in his 150th odi.  25/4
25.2  swann strikes off his second ball loose from virat trying to dab late against the turn and gets the edge through to the keeper swann tossing it up on a length and found some extra bounce which ultimately did virat in  109/3
43.3  hit-wicket kohli's gone he rocked on the back foot to work that square and rocks back far enough to dislodge the bail on middle and leg stump that's gone kieswetter spotted that and appealed and kohli has to go after a delightful innings  236/4
28.5  kp more than redeems himself for that misfield at long on earlier with a superb leaping take on the edge of the long off boundary kohli's look shows it all he looks disgusted in disbelief he had got to the pitch this time and lofted inside-out over extra cover but kp was around on the boundary and leaped two feet in the air to catch it  123/4
41.4  swann strikes! virat kohli is out beating by dip and massive spin off the surface. he played from the crease and was struck on the front pad. did it spin too much? sudhir asnani doesn't think so giving him out quickly. england are giving themselves a chance here  235/5
17.6  kohli hasn't offered a shot and has lost off stump! that ball landed on a good length outside off stump and cut in off the pitch kohli moved forward and lifted his bat out of the way only to the watch the ball come back at him and hit the top of off. it was too full to leave so kohli wouldn't have expected that to cut back off the pitch. double strike from finn.  80/2
44.6  too bad he couldn't stay till the end! kohli makes a bit of room to smash that down the ground but gets a feather edge to ramdin too late for windies though kohli walks back cross with himself but he needn't be it was another responsible innings from him very pleasing to watch  247/4
8.2  narine has his first international wicket and it's the big onbe of kohli it was a length ball an offspinner kohli looks to play it to the leg side looked to have been struck on middle stump umpire was convinced that would have taken leg kohli isn't he doesn't like the decision one bit but that doesn't matter he's on his way that was a tight call  43/3
45.1  kohli is gone. looking to hit a six over long-on but martin sort of cramps him up with the leg line. he can't free the arms and is too close to the ball hence no elevation. easy catch for long-on  241/4
11.2  ponting at shortish backward point holds on to the screamer virat was batting superbly but he is gone now cuts a wide delivery hard but straight to ponting  64/3
18.1  just when kohli was looking set he tries to go over the top of the off side stays at the crease and doesn't get the elevation forrest takes it at sweeper cover  90/2
10.3  appeal for a catch at slip kohli isn't sure if that carried to david hussey at slip outside edge travels low to hussey's right and the catcher was certain he took it cleanly the umpires have a chat and refer it upstairs from the square leg angle it looked alright and the third umpire is convinced. kohli doesn't look too pleased but he has to go  36/4
35.3  perera gets the one that matters kohli is gone as he attempts the pull horrible timing the ball loops towards kulasekara at mid-on surely the end of india's chances  172/5
42.5  and both men got their hundreds in the same over and both men perished in the next virat wanted to carve this one over extra cover but he ended up finding sweeper cover  226/3
35.5  inside edge! loose shot from kohli it was a flatter delivery and kohli made room to drive and ended up getting an inside edge to the base of the leg stump  173/2
47.1  a top edge ends kohli's special knock! like rohit he tries to launch a length ball over the on side and gets a top edge that swirls to point easily taken he walks back to the applause equals the highest score by an indian batsman in a chase  318/4
39.6  kohli has to go a sharp catch at extra cover was the slower one kohli picked it and struck it well but he was looking to clear extra cover there but couldn't get the elevation sachitra senanayake the substitute fielder presumably for kulasekara stayed alert and snapped it well  228/4
5.3  perera and all the sri lankans were convinced and so was the umpire after an eternity! loose shot from kohli chasing a ball wide of the off stump he tried to dab it away towards third man but the keeper detected an edge and went up immediately it took the umpire palliyaguruge a while to give that out either way kohli didn't look too pleased. he did look back though. looking at the replays there was a sound  33/2
20.5  there's the wicket sri lanka were looking for kohli was looking to punch that short of length ball off the back foot he tapped it straight back to herath who gleefully accepts the chance it ws looking very easy for the indian batsmen over the past hour or so  113/2
14.3  trapped in front pradeep angled that in towards middle and leg it moved in kohli likes to shuffle and more often than not he connects well he missed it this time and was caught in front of middle and leg as he was trying to flick it into the leg side. the umpire checks for a no-ball pradeep's foot landed behind the line so kohli has to go. replays also show the ball would have clipped leg stump  77/2
11.6  and again in the midst of a superb spell junaid strikes with an ordinary ball it was heading down the leg side kohli could have let it go instead he tickles it down the leg side kamran akmal - the source of so many cricket jokes over the past few years - pulls off a stunner diving to his left to pluck that one started moving early to anticipate that one the dangerous kohli is gone  55/2
9.3  caught at second slip! the procession continues. length ball pitches on middle and goes across kohli who closes the face of the bat without either going forward or back the ball takes an outside edge and flies low down to younis at second-slip who completes a comfortable catch. india in deep mess again  37/3
25.4  kohli's tried to drive this length delivery through covers took a step out and went hard at it the ball used to race to the deep cover rope when he was in that insane form of his now a thick edge has gone straight to the keeper  138/3
26.2  kohli has holed out he's thrown away a hard-earned start stepping out and slicing a full delivery to the man at sweeper cover he slams the bat into the ground and makes a disappointed-with-himself exit  119/4
16.5  success in the first over for tredwell! he gets the big wicket of kohli. that was tossed up on off stump and kohli drives it softly back to the bowler. it went low to tredwell who makes no mistake and completes the catch. kohli walks away disappointed at that shot  72/2
3.4  caught at second slip! action replay of the previous ball! entices the new man with a floated delivery outside off gets some away movement and kohli who went for the drive edges it to tredwell at second slip this time to his left. tredwell juggles it a few times before completing the catch.  13/2
34.2  india lose a wicket before the powerplay the shot was on and kohli pulled the short ball but he didn't time it and picked out amla at the edge of the deep midwicket rope  210/2
19.6  through the gate! kohli's cameo ends. narine bowls from round the wicket lands on off and middle and goes through with the angle kohli stays on the back foot and tries to work it to the on side missed a straight one  127/2
9.1  gayle glorious at wide slip what a catch brings his big frame down to the right and plucks this thick edge one handed kohli went hard at this good length delivery and not surprisingly it is that man darren sammy again in the region outside off it was angled in and swung away slightly but rather poor stroke from kohli just tried to whack it away wildly  39/2
15.5  big wicket big wicket mathews digs it short into the body kohli hooks and it is malinga who takes it low on the fine-leg boundary kohli bangs bat into the ground as he departs  57/3
49.6  kohli falls but to the final ball of the innings. he gets a length ball tries to clear deep midwicket but can't. just doesn't get the elevation on this. kohli has done the job though  311/7
20.3  kohli is walking it seems. this is plumb. misses the length and goes back to a full ball. to make it worse this doesn't turn. skids through stays low catches him dead in front  76/2
10.4  loud appeal for caught behind which after some time the umpire gives. there was a loud noise when the ball went past the bat and the only doubt was if that had carried to the keeper. once the square leg umpire nodded it was curtains for kohli. beautiful delivery again on a length outside off and just straightening enough to take the outside edge. there wasn't not much of a forward stride by the batsman there  27/2
41.3  he's holed out in the deep! it was tossed up and kohli came down the wicket again and struck it quite well. but vusi sibanda at long on takes a safe catch  216/3
6.2  on a length on middle and off. kohli tries to play through midwicket and ends up spooning to waller who takes a catch. kohli stands his ground and malcolm waller signals for a review from the umpire as it appears that the ball may have bounced before he took the catch. just awaiting confirmation from the umpire. hold on it is out and kohli is walking back to the pavilion. it looked like it had not carried but the umpires must have seen something that we didn't. kohli is incensed as he walks back. this one will be talking point that is certain.  35/2
34.4  that's the end of kohli! watson after sending a few short ones slips in a length delivery and kohli tries to whip this to square leg across the line. he is hit on the knee roll and that would have crashed into the leg stump. the umpire didn't waste any time. that looked plumb the moment it hit the pads. australia on top here excellent bowling from watson again  166/5
29.4  and maxwell has done it the massive wicket of kohli who is dismissed for 68 kohli gets on the front foot initially then gets back and looks to power the ball through off outside off and a thin edge through to the keeper kohli is frustrated at having given it away india's lower order has a big task on their hands now  148/5
31.2  but he's gone now! goes for one hit too many as he looks to loft the ball straight over the bowler's head but mistimes it. sunil narine gets underneath the skier and holds on to a good catch to end kohli's stay at the wicket. so he gets the record but misses on his ton. but statistics aside that was an immensely smooth innings  192/3
39.6  kohli is out for 99 it was a bouncer at the head kohli pulled the ball swirled down to fine leg where the giant holder dives forward to pluck it very low then gets up and roars as kohli stands stunned they check for the no-ball but rampaul is alright  209/5
8.4  kohli's gone in trying to leave the ball it was a late decision he was all set to defend this length delivery when he decided it was rising too much tried to withdraw the bat but the ball brushed it and popped up to the keeper  61/2
14.4  safely pouched at first slip! good delivery by mclaren this was on a good length outside off forced kohli to play at it ended up stabbing at the ball and the edge flew to kallis at first slip  60/2
3.5  and now kohli is gone for a duck! tsotsobe strikes with an angled delivery outside off which was slightly short in length. the batsman tried to steer it down to third man but it just skims off the face of the bat to the keeper.  16/2
44.2  full toss outside off and out of all the deliveries to get him out this turns out to be the one as he just lasers this to ryder who won't make the same mistake twice as he takes this rather nonchalantly while the rest of napier erupts. the napier crowd is good enough to stand up and applaud this sterling effort from the delhi lad  237/7
29.4  and kohli is gone. you read that right. kohli is out. once again looking to slam this one through midwicket but instead lines up long-on quite nicely as the substitute takes a good low catch to remove the cavalier batsman. ends a sublime innings as he had another hundred for the taking  164/4
14.5  and bennett gets the big one as he has kohli who was looking quite scratchy in his short stint edge a good length ball from just outside off to the keeper who takes the catch comfortably. kohli knows it right away as he trudges back to the keeper while bennett kicks off some rather gregarious celebrations from the new zealanders  74/3
3.2  oh he's gone! kohli's top-edged a short ball! it was the first one he faced today and he went for the pull. i wonder if his weight was more on the front foot than it should have been but the ball seemed to come at him a little quicker and all he can do is given an relatively easy skier to jimmy neesham at midwicket  5/1
45.4  would you believe it! bangla_fan's wish has come true. rubel produces a wonderful yorker aimed at the base of off from nowhere and kohli is a touch slow to bring his bat down. the off stump takes a beating..what an innings again! he didn't look like he was getting out tonight.. but this has come too late for bangladesh  267/3
26.3  mendis has done it! the big one his carrom ball has taken out kohli's off stump pitching on middle and slight movement away beats kohli i suppose these days getting kohli for less than a half-century can be counted as a success kohli mimes how the ball moved as he walks off  130/2
9.1  guides it straight into the keeper's hands and gul is off with his best imitation of shoaib akhtar's aeroplane celebration. that is a big wicket and how softly it has fallen. shortish ball outside off kohli tries to guide it away towards third man but gets too fine an edge. bit more bounce and a touch of seam inward outs pakistan on top  56/2
7.4  that's all over! no relief for kohli yet. he tries to take the aggressive option comes down the pitch to woakes and drives powerfully on the up but straight to cook at mid-off. what a gift for england  19/2
25.3  goodness me! almost out of nowhere kohli has picked out mid-on. a full delivery and he tries to flick it through the leg side with plenty of bottom hand and only finds tredwell. a few words are exchanged as kohli ends off. a little heated out there all of a sudden  120/3
6.6  we have seen it a few times this summer! eighth time this summer anderson gets kohli. this is short of length just outside off kohli pokes at that from the crease and gets a thick outside edge. cook at first slip dives low to his right and completes a regulation catch  25/2
40.4  flat strike from kohli and he's failed to clear samuels on the edge of the long off rope wasn't as full from rampaul and kohli had to reach some way forward scooped it powerfully but samuels does well gets on his toes and takes it in front of his head  196/5
45.6  kohli holes out and gives randiv his third wicket on the last ball of his spell! it was a poor delivery very short and on the leg side kohli pulled and only found the fielder in the deep at backward square leg  314/4
42.5  got him! that was nicely flighted outside off and kohli came forward to drive. dipped on him a bit and he hit it uppishly and randiv took a lovely low catch diving forward  256/3
41.4  kohli's holed out to long on as he looked to equal the scores with an attempted six took a couple of steps out made some room to a shortish ball and heaved it straight to long on  236/4
12.5  so easily done! kohli has perished to his own attacking intent. it was just a shade short barely had room to free the hands. short-armed pull came out and ends up as a top edge which is taken by the captain jogging in from mid-on.  59/3
16.4  he is gone! the extra bounce has done him here. he looks to dab the back of length delivery towards third man but this rises up and catches the shoulder of the bat... it flies high and buttler takes a good catch behind the stumps. that is an action replay of kohli's dismissal in the first innings of the brisbane test  64/3
27.1  moeen has struck kohli holes out to long off! he came down the track lofted it straight down the ground and root ran to his right to take a good running catch near the rope. kohli hasn't built the innings at no. 3  103/2
45.2  kohli is gone. gets a wide half-volley that he is not quite close to. he edges it and pakistan finally hold on to an offering from kohli. kohli raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off. big innings in a big match  273/3
27.1  tahir strikes with a long-hop! kohli rocks back to pull hits it straight to faf at short midwicket at chest height. he was sent spinning by the power of the shot but clung on safely enough  136/2
14.6  gone! that was a better short ball on this pitch. batsmen have struggled to pull from outside off on this pitch and kohli's no exception had to meet it at shoulder height top-edges it and he spoons it straight down the throat of the man at long leg  63/3
22.4  and out of nowhere raza has produced a huge wicket as he gets kohli bowled around his legs as the batsmen looked for the sweep round the corner. kohli looked absolutely befuddled once the gravity of the situation came to light. has to go for another 30-odd score this world cup. india in real disarray now  92/4
17.5  kohli is gone. bangladesh have a big wicket here. delivers a fullish length delivery pitched wide outside off as kohli is instinctively drawn into the drive with the ball catching the outside edge to fly over to the keeper who is able to take a good low catch to this right to pluck a huge huge wicket for the bangla tigers. there was some away shape to the ball which also played a part in the dismissal  79/2
15.3  bouncer from mitch top-edged and gone - kohli has cracked! slow start quick end for virat took on the johnson short ball and emphatically lost. it was aimed across him outside off attempted to pull and sent a lusty blow straight up haddin had time to do a little square dance to his left opened up the gauntlets and swallowed india's star man  78/2
12.3  lack of turn does kohli in again. fatally this time. there is a send-off here. kohli is not happy. he stands there and looks at the bangladesh fielders. if not a send-off at least there is something said to him. first the delivery then. this is an offbresk short of a length pitches off looks easy meat for at least a single to leg. kohli plays for the turn the ball not only doesn't turn it also skids through to stay low. plumb lbw  74/2
19.5  tries the big slog sweep but the slowness of the wily shakib has done him in. kohli has not been fluent but he needs to look at the scoreboard. the team is going at six an over. there is no need to play such expansive shots. he is too early into the slog sweep and is beaten all ends up. timbah  114/2
39.6  has he been caught at short fine leg? what a take! steyn bowled a half-volley on the pads a delivery kohli should have put away. he flicked the ball uppishly but it was dying on the tall morne morkel at short fine leg. morkel got down low and caught the ball in his fingertips before it hit the ground. is the tide turning decisively now?  214/3
45.1  morkel wins this moment. what a wicket this is. is this the defining moment? short on leg and kohli can only heave the ball in the air to miller at deep midwicket who takes a comfortable catch. this line length and field placement has worked wonders so far. stalled kohli throughout the second part of his innings. take a bow russell domingo and ab de villiers  216/5
48.2  that's the end of kohli he's caught behind for 138! shortish ball going down leg and he pulled got a faint edge and qdk took it easily  291/5
7.4  chases the wide one and edges it again! de kock take a bow. that is a catch that will be replayed forever. he might well be the best odi keeper around right now. rabada goes full kohli has to reach for it because he is lead-footed. it was a run-scoring opportunity because it is almost an overpitched delivery. but the extra pace seems to work against the batsman. big nick which means it hurtles between slip and the keeper. de kock flings himself full length to his right and plucks it with one hand  44/2
44.3  kohli's hit that hard off the front foot he's hit that flat and the ball is headed over the long-on boundary but finch runs to his left and takes the catch at head height. kohli falls close to his hundred after an outstanding partnership. he's set india up for a huge total but can the remaining batsmen hit from the get-go? kohli timed that really well just did not hit it high enough  243/2
46.2  kohli steps out and hits it straight into the lap of extra cover. hastings rolls his fingers across this slower one outside off 120ks kohli slaps it to bailey. looked like a leg-breakish slower one. kohli who can't manufacture his own pace is out for a run-a-ball 117  265/4
20.2  out! big big wicket this. very full and wide from hastings. kohli goes for the expansive drive and gets a thin nick through to the keeper. wade takes it over his head. australia are a delighted bunch. huge moment in the game  134/2
11.4  gone. kohli has been strangled down leg. flat delivery down leg kohli flicks but gets just a thin edge which is wonderfully taken by ronchi well down leg. kohli has a smile on his face. knew he hit that. unfortunate way to go.  40/2
19.5  and gone. kohli falls. short and wide outside off a terrible delivery. kohli goes back and gets a thin edge which is well taken by watling. not much turn but there may have been some extra bounce or kohli just played for some. either way what was turning into another typical kohli chase has been cut short almost literally.  98/2
43.1  picks out long-off! he was placed wider keeping in mind kohli's ability to hit those inside out drives. that is the shot he goes for. came down the track took the ball on the half-volley and seemed to have struck it so well. the problem was it was straight at guptill who is perhaps new zealand's best fielder. kohli is livid as he walks off.  220/5
36.2  oh kohli for once has failed to finish off a chase. it's that man stokes again but is it too late? kohli has played a modern classic here. slower short ball he looks to pull from outside off and gets a top edge. kohli knows he has made a mistake and his head falls away right away. willey takes the catch at cover and the crowd stands up for a great innings. kohli acknowledges the crowd's response but he is bitterly disappointed he is not there when the winning runs are hit  263/5
2.6  stokes nabs kohli now. this is a huuuuuge scalp. second slip dives low to his left and clings onto it with both hands. this is very very full and wide outside off - a near yorker - kohli reaches out and jabs his bat down on the ball. takes the outside edge stokes is late to react but pouches it. no feet from kohli. the cuttack crowd has been hushed into silence  22/2
25.5  he's got him! pradeep you beauty baiting kohli outside off and nabbing him easily. the shot is risky with a slip in but the batsman goes for the glide to third man anyway. a touch of seam movement away but more importantly a little extra bounce undoes him.  139/2
2.4  got him next ball. amir you legend! he takes flight. he punches the air like it spoke ill of his family. a fit even a half fit bowler like him is worth tons for a team. this is back of a length on off stump and kohli looking to move across and flick into the on side gets a leading edge straight to point. amir makes him play early. amir sends him back. amir puts a smile on pakistan's face. amir is making the oval chant his name  6/2
41.2  holes out to long-on looking for another big six. slower ball from joseph rolls his fingers over the seam and the ball does not come on too well as a result. tries to launch it and gets the elevation but not the distance. nurse settles under it comfortably  285/5
9.3  oh good catch! kyle hope has made amends! back of a length outside off stump he's on the front foot early and then he sees this lift up off the pitch. it's chest height and he pokes at it. thick outside edge that hangs to the left of gully for a moment before the fielder there hope leaps one-handed to his left and gets rid of kohli. holder has his man  34/2
5.6  for the second match in a row holder has dismissed kohli after troubling him with the short ball. good bouncer just outside off similar to the one that he missed a few balls ago. this time he gets a top-edge that goes straight up three storeys up and shai hope takes a few steps forward and wraps his gloves around it  25/2
17.3  kohli's gone! 4 off 2! dananjaya spinning a web around these indian batsmen. what's happening. yikes. wow. another googly this one is soooo full but kohli still does not manage to get bat on that. it's full and straight kohli takes his pads away from the line of the ball looking for that trademark whippy cover drive but all that does it create a massive bat-pad gap and the stumps are disturbed again. sl in raptures.  118/4
5.1  gone! fernando's got his man. not the way he must have visualised getting the indian captain out but he won't care. it's not exactly a wicket-taking ball on the pads and asking to be flicked. but kohli's maybe a touch early on it and maybe the left-armer's inswing makes him hit it finer than he'd like and he ends up flicking in the air to the man stationed at long leg. chameera's the fielder and he takes it brilliantly diving forward as it dips on him  19/2
29.3  gone! malinga has his 300th wicket! not the greatest delivery he's ever bowled but he won't mind - he's found a way to break this partnership. a full wide ball and kohli drives in the air straight to the sweeper on the cover point boundary  225/2
37.5  and chopped on! kohli falls for 92. the ball has been seaming back in kohli chooses the wrong option of playing a dab down to third man the ball takes the inside edge and hits the stumps. maybe his first mistake of the day. fantastic innings anyway  197/5
24.2  happens again. kohli has done it again it was always going to happen and i think coulter-nile was playing for that. good length outside off the ball seaming back in kohli tries to dab this down to third man but it takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. that's another error from kohli and the worst thing is he has repeated the mistake from kolkata. it is a nice shot to a ball that is slightly wide and when the ball isn't seaming in.  147/3
39.4  such a good-looking shot and it may have been six in bengaluru but here it's caught by long-off comfortably. tossed up on off stump and he looks to loft this inside-out ends up scooping it straight into the hands of long-off  227/3
49.2  six and out. but he's done his job much more actually. it's shortish around off kohli uses his bottom hand to swing through the line the ball lobs to long-on where boult takes a simple catch. a tired acknowledgement of the applause what fitness superb innings  270/7
13.5  caught behind excellent work from latham! it's the cross-seamer which tends to bounce a touch more if the seam hits the pitch. kohli going for a drive away from his body feathers a nick to the wicketkeeper who has done really well standing up. rising with the ball taking it ever so smoothly  79/2
31.1  caught at cover! the flay often works for kohli even when he tries to hit on the up especially when he has so much room. but morris the fresh bowler has a little more gas to hit the deck and get the extra bounce to knock over the india captain.  178/2
