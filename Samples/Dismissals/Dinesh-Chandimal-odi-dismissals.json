The appeal was a very strong one from the bowler and keeper. This is a length ball coming in from wide of the crease, Chandimal walks across the stumps to help it over short fine but is struck in front of the stumps. There was certainly no bat. The ball was in line with the stumps and would've hit middle and leg"
