    "description": "Caught  or grounded? is the question. Replays suggest it was a clean catch . Guptill has to go, after he gets confirmation from the third umpire. Guptill  pressed back to punch it away from the body and Shehzad dived forward full towards the ball at point to pouch it. Smart catch. 80 for 3 and NZ are wobbling here. The umpires have told the batsman to wait. They go upstairs. Shehzad dived forward, caught the ball cleanly above the ground and the question is when he landed did the ball touch the ground. But the right palm came under the ball at that point and the ball doesn't seem to have touched the ground. Out!"

Looks to make a bit of room and hit over mid-off, but the length isn't full enough for that. Hits high on the bat and balloons up for mid-off to move a few steps to his left and catch it"

    "description": "floated up and Guptill goes after it again, skewed low towards cover this time - and has Stokes plucked a peach here?! Guptill is hanging around but Stokes is confident and the soft signal is out from the on-field umpires; is there anything to overrule on the replay? No, looks like it went skimming straight into those big paws, and England have another! Guptill struck it pretty well but it picked out one of the best fielders on the park, big wicket"
