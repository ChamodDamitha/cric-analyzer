Good length outside off, fifth-stump line, it's not wide enough for Dhawan to cut, and Dhawan feels he needs to play because of that previous delivery and with Boult getting the ball to hold its line. This one, though, pitches and swings further away, and Dhawan wafts at it needlessly. Gets a thick outside edge which flies at chest height to Latham's left. That's Boult's wicket, set him up with some superb bowling."

In the mean time, Kohli tried to steal a single as the ball rolled pitch side into the off side. Two people in the game are still alive to the possibilities at this point - Kohli at the non-strikers end and Markram at point. Dhawan isn't ready for this run but Kohli is already halfway down. In the frenzy of the noise and the visuals, he decides to run because he doesn't seem to have a choice. Markram picks up with one hand and finishes the throw perfectly"
