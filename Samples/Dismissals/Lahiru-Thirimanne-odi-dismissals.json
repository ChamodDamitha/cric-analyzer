Back of a length, slanting across, but this one comes back into Thirimanne. Caught on the crease again, shuffling across but not going forward or back.

From one angle, his front heel is hidden behind the non-striker's bat, and from the other it's hidden behind the midwicket fielder. The stump-cam angle was inconclusive too, with the heel landing extremely close to the back of the line - whether behind it or on top of it was hard to tell - and given the evidence he had, the third umpire had to send the batsman on his way"}, {"bowler": {"type": "Right-arm offbreak", "name": "Washington Sundar"}, "Stadium": "Mohali", "team_innings": "2", "dismissal": {"wayOut": "bowled"}, "batsman": {"batting-hand": "left", "name": "Lahiru Thirimanne"}, "player_innings": {"runs": "21", "balls": "35", "4s": "1", "6s": "0", "batting_position": "3"}, "ball": "15.3", "opposition": {"country": "India", "total": "392/4 (50 Overs, RR: 7.84)"}, "team": {"country": "SL ", "total": "251/8 (50 Overs, RR: 5.02)"}, "date": "13 Dec 2017", "scoreAt": "62/3", "description": "bowled him, that's his first ODI wicket.
