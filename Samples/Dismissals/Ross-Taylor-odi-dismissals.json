The ball flies off the outer edge and to left of Dilshan who dives to low to his left, scoops up the ball on his left-hand,. it bobs up and Dilshan, now lying on his back, grabs it off the second attempt. Umpires have a chat and give it out.   Replays tell a different story. When the ball bobbed up from the left palm, it touched the grass when Dilshan tried to grab it! Hmm........

Vaas get it at a good length and Taylor comes forward trying to whack it across the line. Misses the ball and is struck on the pads, not much deviation after pitching and the ball might have gone on to miss off but Taufel gives it out. Taylor's forgettable stay comes to an end, Vaas's accuracy is awarded with a wicket. Another debatable decision. The umpires have really struggled on the day"
